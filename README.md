# my-power-toys (Macos Shortcuts on Windows)
This repo is my Microsoft Windows Power Toys backup. Basically its repo for keeping a record of remapping shortcuts that match with Mac OS so that if I have to use Windows, I am not super flustered by the keyboard shortcuts.

I have kept `Alt` as the `Command` key. I understands its actually the `Super`/`Windows` key but, just to go in another painful keyboard remapping process, I just kept it like that. Because that is where your thumb would naturally go to if you're used to a Mac.

Here are some of the keyboard remappings that this would apply:

- `Alt` + `Backspace` ➜ `Shift` + `Home`  - Basically command + backspace deletes whole line from the cursor to the start, and there is no way to do that on Windows, so this key just selects the text for you to start typing.
- `Alt` + `Right`/`Left` ➜ `End`/`Home` - Command + Right/left takes you to the end of lines, this happens with home/end key on Windows.
- `Alt` + `C` ➜ `Ctrl` + `C`
- `Alt` + `V` ➜ `Ctrl` + `V`
- `Alt` + `X` ➜ `Ctrl` + `X`
- `Alt` + `S` ➜ `Ctrl` + `A`
- `Alt` + `Space` ➜ `Win` - Generally Command + Space is used to launch applications with the spotlight search, Windows key has the closest effect to that. You can press win and start typing, so this is going to take care of that.
- `Alt` + `W` ➜ `Ctrl` + `W`
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Shift` + `4` ➜ `Win` + `Shift` + `S` - To capture screenshot of area and copy it to clipboard.
