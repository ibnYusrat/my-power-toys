# my-power-toys (Macos Shortcuts on Windows)
This repo is my Microsoft Windows Power Toys backup. Basically its repo for keeping a record of remapping shortcuts that match with Mac OS so that if I have to use Windows, I am not super flustered by the keyboard shortcuts.

Here are some of the keyboard remappings that this would apply:

- `Alt` + `Backspace` ➜ `Shift` + `Home`  - Basically command + backspace deletes whole line from the cursor to the start, and there is no way to do that on Windows, so this key just selects the text for you to start typing.
- `Alt` + `Right`/`Left` ➜ `End`/`Home` - Command + Right/left takes you to the end of lines, this happens with home/end key on Windows.
- `Alt` + `C` ➜ `Ctrl` + `C`
- `Alt` + `V` ➜ `Ctrl` + `V`
